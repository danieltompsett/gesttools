\description{
Performs g-estimation of a structural nested mean model (SNMM), based on the outcome regression methods described
in Sjolander and Vansteelandt (2016) and Dukes and Vansteelandt (2018). We assume a dataset with a time-varying outcome that is either binary or continuous,
time-varying and/or baseline confounding, and a time-varying exposure that is either binary or continuous.
}
\details{
Suppose a series of time periods \eqn{1,\ldots,T+1} whereby a time-varying exposure and confounder (\eqn{A_t=a_t} and \eqn{L_t=l_t}) are measured over times \eqn{t=1,\ldots,T} and
a time varying outcome \eqn{Y_s=y_s} is measured over times \eqn{s=2,\ldots,T+1}. Define \eqn{c=s-t} as the step length, that is the number of time periods separating an exposure measurement, and subsequent outcome measurement.
By using the transform \eqn{t=s-c}, \code{gestmult} estimates the causal parameters \eqn{\psi} of a SNMM of the form
 \deqn{E\{Y_s(\bar{a}_{s-c},0)-Y_s(\bar{a}_{s-c-1},0)|\bar{a}_{s-c-1},\bar{l}_{s-c}\}=\psi z_{sc}a_{s-c} \; \forall c=1,\ldots,T\; and\; \forall s>c}
 if Y is continuous or
 \deqn{\frac{E(Y_s(\bar{a}_{s-c},0)|\bar{a}_{s-c-1},\bar{l}_{s-c-1})}{E(Y_s(\bar{a}_{s-c-1},0)|\bar{a}_{s-c-1},\bar{l}_{s-c-1})}=exp(\psi z_{sc}a_{s-c}) \; \forall c=1,\ldots,T\; and \; \forall s>c }
 if Y is binary. The SNMMs form is defined by the parameter \eqn{z_{sc}}, which can be controlled by the input \code{type} as follows
 \itemize{
 \item{\code{type=1} }{sets \eqn{z_{sc}=1}. This implies that \eqn{\psi} is now the effect of exposure at any time t on all subsequent outcome periods.}
 \item{\code{type=2} }{sets \eqn{z_{sc}=c(1,l_{s-c})} and adds affect modification by the first named variable in \code{Lny}, which we denote \eqn{L_t}. Now \eqn{\psi=c(\psi_0,\psi_1)} where \eqn{\psi_0} is the effect of exposure at any time t on all subsequent outcome periods, when \eqn{l_{s-c}=0} at all times t, modified by
 \eqn{\psi_1} for each unit increase in \eqn{l_{s-c}} at all times t. Note that effect modification
 is currently only supported for binary or continuous confounders.}
 \item{\code{type=3} }{can posit a time-varying causal effect for each value of \eqn{c}, that is the causal effect for the exposure on outcome \eqn{c} time periods later.
 We set \eqn{z_{sc}} to a vector of zeros of length T with a 1 in the \eqn{c=s-t}'th position. Now \eqn{\psi=c(\psi_{1},\ldots,\psi_{T})}
 where \eqn{\psi_(c)} is the effect of exposure on outcome \eqn{c} time periods later for all outcome periods \eqn{s>c} that is \eqn{A_{s-c}} on \eqn{Y_s}.}
 \item{\code{type=4} }{allows for a time-varying causal effect that can be modified by the first named variable in \code{Lny}, that is it allows for both time-varying effects and effect modification. It sets \eqn{z_{sc}} to a vector of zeros of length T with \eqn{c(1,l_{s-c})} in the \eqn{c=s-t}'th position.
 Now \eqn{\psi=(\underline{\psi_1},\ldots,\underline{\psi_T})} where \eqn{\underline{\psi_c}=c(\psi_{0c},\psi_{1c})}. Here \eqn{\psi_{0c}} is the effect of exposure on outcome \eqn{c} time periods later, given \eqn{l_{s-c}=0} for all \eqn{s>c}, modified by
 \eqn{\psi_{1c}} for each unit increase in \eqn{l_{s-c}} for all \eqn{s>c}. Note that effect modification
 is currently only supported for binary or continuous confounders.}
 }
 The data must be in long format, where we assume the convention that each row with \code{time=t} contains \eqn{A_t,L_t} and \eqn{C_{t+1},Y_{t+1}}. That is the censoring indicator for each row
 should indicate that a user is censored AFTER time t and the outcome indicates the first outcome that occurs AFTER \eqn{a_t} and \eqn{l_t} are measured.
 For example, data at time 1, should contain \eqn{A_1}, \eqn{L_1}, \eqn{Y_{2}}, and optionally \eqn{C_2}. If either A or Y are binary, they must be written as numeric vectors taking values either 0 or 1.
 The same is true for any covariate that is used for effect modification.\cr
 The data must be rectangular with a row entry for every individual for each exposure time 1 up to T. Data rows after censoring should be empty apart from the ID and time variables. This can be done using the function \code{\link{FormatData}}.\cr
 By default the censoring, propensity and outcome models include the exposure history at the previous time as a variable. One may consider also including all previous exposure and confounder history as variables in \code{Lny},\code{Lnp}, and \code{LnC} if necessary.\cr
 Censoring weights are handled as described in Sjolander and Vansteelandt (2016). Note that it is necessary that any variable included in \code{LnC} must also be in \code{Lnp}. Missing data not due to censoring is automatically handled by removing rows with missing data prior to fitting the model. If outcome models fail to fit, consider removing covariates from \code{Lny} but keeping
 them in \code{Lnp} to reduce collinearity issues, or consider the sparseness of the data.
