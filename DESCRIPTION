Version: 1.3.0
Author: Daniel Tompsett, Stijn Vansteelandt, Oliver Dukes, Bianca De Stavola
Maintainer: Daniel Tompsett <danieltompsettwork@gmail.com>
Description: Provides a series of general purpose tools to perform g-estimation using the methods described in Sjolander and Vansteelandt (2016) <doi:10.1515/em-2015-0005> and Dukes and Vansteelandt <doi:10.1093/aje/kwx347>. The package allows for g-estimation in a wide variety of circumstances, including an end of study or time-varying outcome, and an exposure that is a binary, continuous, or a categorical variable with three or more categories. The package also supports g-estimation with time-varying causal effects and effect modification by a confounding variable.
